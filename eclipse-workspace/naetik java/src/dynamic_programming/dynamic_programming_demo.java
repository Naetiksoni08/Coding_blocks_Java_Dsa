// those who cannot remember their past are condemned to repeat it 
// when to use dynamic_programming
//1. program overlapping 
// 2. optimal subset
// there are two types of approach to solve dynamic_programming
// top down and bottom up 
// top down is also called recursive approach(memoisation)
// bottom up is also called iterative approach (it is called tabulation)
// always remember bottom up approach in dynamic programming is a little bit faster than the then the top down approach this is because bottom up approach uses iterative method (or tabulation) method which is faster than the recursive approach 
// agar recursion piche se chal raha hai toh table aage se fill hoga that means if recursion is starting from n th index then the loop will be run from 0th index and vice versa that means if recursion is running from 0th index then the table will be filled or loop will work from nth index
